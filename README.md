# Bioquimica
Case study of curricular unit "Bioquimica" of my Bioinformatics degree.

# What is this?
This is a repository about the curricular unit "Bioquimica" of my Bioinformatics degree where I and my classmates made some case study.

# 1st case study
The 1st case study was about analysis of the characteristics of the amino acids, regarding the physicochemical properties of the side 
chain, the description of the amino acid titration and determination of its isoelectric point and, finally, indicate the charge of each 
of the amino acids at PH 7.

# 2nd case study
The 2nd case study was about primary, the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of the peptide studied in the previous case study. 
It also focused on acid-base behavior, physicochemical properties, and migration pattern. 

# What I've learned?
With this case studies from the curricular unit "Bioquimica" of my Bioinformatics degree I've learned about analysis of the characteristics of the amino acids, regarding the physicochemical properties of the side 
chain, the description of the amino acid titration and determination of its isoelectric point and, finally, indicate the charge of each 
of the amino acids at PH 7, primary, the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of the peptide studied in the previous case study. 
It also focused on acid-base behavior, physicochemical properties, and migration pattern.
